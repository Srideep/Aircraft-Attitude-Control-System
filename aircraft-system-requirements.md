## 2. System Overview

### 2.1 System Context
The ACS operates as a fly-by-wire attitude control system that interfaces between pilot commands and aircraft control surfaces. It receives attitude commands from the pilot, measures current aircraft attitude, and commands appropriate control surface deflections to achieve and maintain desired attitude.

### 2.2 Major Functions
1. **Attitude Measurement**: Process sensor data to determine current aircraft attitude
2. **Command Processing**: Interpret pilot attitude commands
3. **Control Law Execution**: Calculate required control surface positions
4. **Safety Monitoring**: Ensure commands remain within safe flight envelope
5. **Actuator Command**: Output control surface commands to actuators

### 2.3 User Characteristics
Primary users are certified pilots operating light general aviation aircraft in normal flight conditions. The system assumes basic pilot training and familiarity with aircraft attitude control concepts.

### 2.4 Operational Environment
- Operating altitude: 0 to 15,000 feet MSL
- Temperature range: -20°C to +50°C
- Vibration: Per DO-160G Category S
- EMI/EMC: Per DO-160G
